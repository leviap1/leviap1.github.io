### About Me
I am located in Redondo Beach, California. As of September 2025, I will be attending UCLA for two years to earn my bachelors degree in Political Science, with plans to attend law school after my undergraduate studies.<br>

### Interests
My interest in photography is mainly in wildlife. I'm extremely fascinated by animals and I believe that capturing them is really neat. I lack confidence in my ability to creatively capture landscape photography, and therefore, don't do it as much as I'd like to. <br> Aside from my interest in photography, I enjoy playing video games, hanging out with my family, and as of lately, studying and learning more about the Middle East.

### Current Gear
The camera body that I currently use is the Canon EOS R8. I've been pairing it with the RF 100-400 f/5.6-8 and the EF 24-105 f/4L (adapted).
